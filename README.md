Creating a Video Captioning Model using a pre-trained transformer model from Hugging Face (timesformer), as well as adding transcripting and a text summarizer for that to understanding audio information. 



Created a report justifying the use of my model along with other suitable models such as VALOR to extract audio and visual information from a video file. 
Created a flow chart for explanability.
